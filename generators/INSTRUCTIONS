The Simple Tooltips plugin is now installed. 

Please be sure that your application layout templates (where you want to use tooltips)
have the following code in them: 

yield :head
yield :javascript

Ensure that yield :javascript appears after Prototype or jQuery are loaded. 
 
To make a tooltip, do this in your views:

<div id="needs_tooltip">
  Some content
</div>

<%= tooltip_for('needs_tooltip', 'This will be displayed when you mouseover Some content.') %>
